This page lists various remote sensing datasets.

## BigEarthNet
The BigEarthNet dataset is composed of largely cloud-free Sentinel-2 image patches (L2A) from 2018 labeled from the CORINE 2018 dataset.

[comment]: <> (Hi Gabriel, ich denke, jedes Dataset sollte in einem Satz vorgestellt werden. Ohne Details, typischerweise mit Bild für Print ca. 500x500 pixel. Das muss aber nicht sofort sein.)

*Key Features:*
* Number of images:  590.326
* Number of classes: 19 (new) / 43 (old)
* Label type: multi label
* geo-referenced: Yes
* Image resolution:
  + 120 × 120 pixels for 10m bands
  + 60 × 60 pixels for 20m bands
  + 20 × 20 pixels for 60m bands
