title: Supervised and Unsupervised methods in Data-Mining
categories: [Kolmogorov Complexity, Remote Sensing, Master Thesis]
excerpt: In this project, we created a novel approach for trajectory similarity based on Kolmogorov complexity approximated by a lossy compression of the original trajectory data using selected features compressed into a concise memory representation by means of a Bloom filter.

During the last decades, the Earth has been changing rapidly. For instance, with the
change of its temperature, the glaciers are melting. The number of humans as well
as natural disasters have increased considerably. The impact of these events causes
short-time, but also long-time damages to the regions, which are affected. In order
to show the impact of these events to their surrounding area, multispectral as well as
Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images have been classified by their content. The
classification was done in a supervised approach, using a Support Vector Machine with
relevance feedback, as well as an alternative unsupervised parameter-free and featurefree
approach based on Kolmogorov Complexity. With the supervised approach it is
possible to show the effects of certain events on their area, while the unsupervised
approach can create a change map in a binary form derived from a satellite image time
series. With this change map one can recognize the impact of the event.

**Publications**: The work from the master thesis has been published in five papers.
