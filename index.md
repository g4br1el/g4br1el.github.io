# About Me
Software Engineering is like Rock Climbing, first we must understand the problem before we are able to do something. Furthermore, plans arenâ€™t solid always be prepared for the unexpected.

A dedicated and creative software developer who loves solving complex problems. My fields of interest are software engineering, machine learning and distributed systems. I was writing my master thesis at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and is about unsupervised parameter-free feature-free methods in data mining.
# Research Interests
